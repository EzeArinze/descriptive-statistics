# descriptive-statistics

# Class: Statistics

## Constructor

Initializes the Statistics instance with a list of numbers.

## Methods:

### calculateMean()

Calculates the average of the number's, it add's all the numbers in the list(get's the total) and divide's it with the total numbers.

### calculateMedian()

Determine the median value of the number e.g if the we have 1,2,3,4,5, the the median here is 3 but if we have 1,2,3,4,5,6 it will then add 3 and 4 and divide's with 2.

### calculateMode()

Get's or identify the frequently occurring value e.g 1,2,3,4,5,5 then 5 is our mode.

### calculateRange()

Determine's the difference between the maximum and the minimum e.g 1,2,3,4,5,6 the maximum = 6 and the minimum = 1.

### calculateVariance()

Determin'es the measure of how far a set of data (numbers) are spread out of their mean(average).

### calculateStandardDeviation()

Get's the square root of the variance.

### calculateMeanDeviation()

calculate the average deviation from the mean value of the given data set.
Step 1: Find the mean value for the given data values.

Step 2: Now, subtract the mean value from each of the data values given (Note: Ignore the minus symbol).

Step 3: Now, find the mean of those values obtained in step 2.

### calculateQuartileDeviation()

Calculate's the quartile deviation (the difference between the first quartile and the third quartile) of the numbers.

### calculatePercentile()

Calculate's the percentile value of the numbers based on the given percentile.
